ladistitcher
===============================================================================

Work-in-progress audio system manager for my personal systems.
While this project isn't really meant for public consumption, I feel that some
might benefit from the release of this code.

In its current state, ladistitcher is designed specifically for my main system.
In the future, I may figure out some sort of hardware probing and/or
configuration system so that it can be used on other systems, but this is
unlikely. I do plan on making it adaptable to an extent, but only so much so
that any changes to my setup will only require a few edits to the code, rather
than a complete overhaul.

Part of the reason I am making this code public is because parts of
ladistitcher will serve as jumping-off points for other projects. For example,
as of this writing, it would not take many changes to turn audio_control.ladi
into a standalone Python module for ladish.
